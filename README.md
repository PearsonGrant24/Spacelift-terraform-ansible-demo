# 🚀 Terraform + Ansible on AWS 

🚀 New DevOps Project Drop: Fully Automated AWS Infrastructure with Terraform, Ansible
 
After some time focusing on learning and growth, I’m excited to share a new DevOps project I’ve been building — one that brings together Infrastructure as Code, automated configuration management, and best-practice deployment workflows.
This project simulates a real production environment and includes:

🔧 Infrastructure Automation (Terraform)
• VPC, subnets, EC2 provisioning
• Secure networking and reusable modules
• Automated, repeatable environment creation

🛠️ Configuration Management (Ansible)
• Server bootstrapping
• Automated package installation
• App deployment using structured playbooks
• Handling real-world issues like inventory parsing, SSH access, Python installation, etc.

☁️ AWS Cloud Architecture
• Compute
• Networking
• Security
• Automation from scratch
